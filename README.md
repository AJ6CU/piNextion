CECNextionEmulator is a Nextion emulator for the KD8CEC software that runs on the uBITX. Since it is pretends to be a Nextion (at least as far as the CEC software can tell), there is no software changes required. It also works with both the original 1.x KD8CEC software as well as my CEC 2.0 fork that targets Pico and Teensy MCU's.

The software runs on MacOS, Linux and Windows. I have tested the Linux version on a RaspberryPi 4/4gb and although the startup takes a little longer than on my RaspberryPi 5, the user interface performance is acceptable after it gets going. Generally any desktop processor is going to have too much speed, indeed I had to put in a trap to ensure that the computer running cecNext doesn't overrun the poor Nano on the Raduino. (Even my Pico Raduino's had issues with being overrun!)

It is especially nice on Touchscreens. A 1280x800 is the minimum touchscreen size. There are some inexpensive case/screens for RaspberryPi 4 and 5 such as this one which is for the RaspberryPi 4:

Installation requires you to install the cecNextion software and reroute the wires that went originally to the Nextion thru a USB to TTL Serial converter such as https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BJKCSZZW. There are no other changes required to your uBITX assuming you have already made a Nextion converter.

Using the original Nextion harness colors:

- Black - Ground
- Red - Power ( I left the jumper off)
- Blue -   TXD (Nextion) to  RX Pin (D8) (Raduino)
- Yellow - RXD (Nextion) to  TX Pin (D9)  (Raduino)

Unless you are real good at crimping jst connectors, I would highly recommend you get a pre-crimpt set like:

I created a harness using a 4 slot male connector for the plug that would have gone into the nextion  and mated it to a 6 slot female connector that plugs into the TTL-USB connector. (seel below). With this connector, i can swap between the TTL-USB and the Nextion by just a quick unplug/plug operation.

###Key Features
1. Touchscreen and Mouse support
2. Use of dials for ATT, IFS and Frequency Tuning
3. Ability to change individual digits of VFO A from main screen
4. Channel Scanning - Any or all the 20 Channels can be put into a set to be scanned
5. Indication that VFO is displaying the TX Frequency (very useful for CW)
6. Local backup/restore of key Radio settings

I have included some screen shots below.

**The first time you run cecNext you will see this. You need to select the communication port**

**WARNING: One surprising UX "features"**
At first I thought this was a bug, but later found out it was a "feature". If you use a mouse, you click on the "Mode" button and then click again to select the Mode (e.g. CWL). But on a Touchscreen, you tap the "Mode" button, and you drag your finger (without releasing) to the desired Mode. When you reach it, lift your finger. I originally thought this was a Bug and spent multiple hours tracking it down to find it was a feature...


###Unsupported Features of Original Nextion/CEC Screens
The following are the features from the original Nextion/CEC screens that have not yet (and may never) be supported:
1. Anything dependent on the auxilary processor
2. Band scanning
3. CW decoding
4. Monitoring A0-A7 Analog lines
5. Let me know what else...

I have created an initial Alpha release for those brave folks. You can download it here
